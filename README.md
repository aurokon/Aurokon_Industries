Big shout out to CK_Dexterhaven for helping me with this and another shoutout to Iaanp for his guide! Between that guide and CK's help,
I was able to get my first working mod completed and functioning!

This is a pretty basic mod. New workshop tab has 5 prefab kits. The kits only contain building pieces. No benches.
In theory, this mod shouldn't need updated every week. Once I have the expansion, I'll work on adding kits for the new building materials.

Each kit contains the following:
Frame x16
Walls x18
Ramps x16
Floors x16
Reinforced Doors x2
Angled Walls x16
Beams x16

# Aurokon Industries

A big shoutout to CK_Dexterhaven for their invaluable assistance, and another shoutout to Iaanp for their helpful guide! Thanks to the combination of CK's guidance and Iaanp's tutorial, I was able to successfully create my first working mod, which is now fully functional.

In theory, this mod should not require frequent updates. However, I plan to work on incorporating kits for the new building materials once I have access to the expansion.

## Mod Description
This is a straightforward mod that introduces a new workshop tab featuring 5 prefab kits. These kits exclusively contain building pieces and do not include any benches. Each kit is available for research and can be purchased with Ren.

Each kit contains the following items:
- Frame x16
- Walls x18
- Ramps x16
- Floors x16
- Reinforced Doors x2
- Angled Walls x16
- Beams x16

## Installation Instructions

1. Open Steam.
2. Navigate to your games library.
3. Right-click on "Icarus" and select "Manage."
4. Choose "Browse Local Files."
5. In the new window that appears, open the "Icarus" folder, followed by the "content" folder, and then the "paks" folder.
6. If the "mods" folder does not exist within the "paks" folder, create it.
7. Place the "Aurokon Industries.pak" file into the "mods" folder.

For the best installation experience, it is recommended to use IMM (Icarus Mod Manager) to extract and install the mod, especially if you are using multiple mods.

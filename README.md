# Aurokon Industries

Updates are coming soon.


A big shoutout to **CK_Dexterhaven** for his invaluable assistance, and another shoutout to **Iaanp** for their helpful guide! Thanks to the combination of CK's guidance and Iaanp's tutorial, I was able to successfully create my first fully functional mod.
In theory, this mod should not require weekly updates.

## Mod Description
This is a straightforward mod that introduces a new workshop tab featuring 5 prefab kits. These kits exclusively contain building pieces and do not include any benches. Each kit is available for research and can be purchased with Ren.

Each kit contains the following items:
- Frame x20
- Walls x24
- Ramps x20
- Floors x20
- Reinforced Doors x2
- Angled Walls x10
- Beams x20

## Installation Instructions

1. Open Steam.
2. Navigate to your games library.
3. Right-click on "Icarus" and select "Manage."
4. Choose "Browse Local Files."
5. In the new window that appears, open the "Icarus" folder, followed by the "content" folder, and then the "paks" folder.
6. If the "mods" folder does not exist within the "paks" folder, create it.
7. Place the "Aurokon Industries.pak" file into the "mods" folder.

For the best installation experience, it is recommended to use IMM (Icarus Mod Manager) to extract and install the mod, especially if you are using multiple mods.

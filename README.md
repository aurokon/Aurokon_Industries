# Aurokon Industries
Big shoutout to CK_Dexterhaven for helping me with this and another shoutout to Iaanp for his guide! Between that guide and CK's help,
I was able to get my first working mod completed and functioning!
In theory, this mod shouldn't need updated every week. Once I have the expansion, I'll work on adding kits for the new building materials.

This is a pretty basic mod. New workshop tab has 5 prefab kits. The kits only contain building pieces. No benches.
Each kit can be researched and purchased with Ren. 

Each kit contains the following:
Frame x16
Walls x18
Ramps x16
Floors x16
Reinforced Doors x2
Angled Walls x16
Beams x16


# Installation Instructions:

1) Open Steam
2) Navigate to your games library
3) Right click on Icarus and move the point down to Manage
4) Select "Browse Local Files"
5) In the new window that pops up, open the Icarus folder, then the content folder, then the paks folder
6) If you don't have a mods folder inside the paks folder, just create it and name it mods
7) Place Aurokon Industries.pak into this folder

The preferred method would be to use IMM to extract the mod and then install it and is highly suggested if you're using multiple mods.
